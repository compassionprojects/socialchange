      about_content_html: "<p>The goal of this project is to show the impact of NVC in social change to influence policy and lessen the harms of punitive systems.</p>

      <p>Current situation is that there is no one place on the internet where you can find all social change stories where NVC is involved. They are all spread over, which makes it difficult to find.</p>

      <p>With our centralising of all stories, we hope to 1) show the impact of NVC 2) let people around the world inspire each other by telling their stories 3) let people around the world engage with each other, build a community around and take action.</p>

      <p>If you are interested in helping out, please share this page with relevant people. We are just a bunch of people inspired by NVC and what it can bring to our lives. We are doing all of this openly and transparently. If you find this project meaningful and see any value feel free to donate - we use opencollective which offers complete transparency on how your donations will be utilised.</p>"
